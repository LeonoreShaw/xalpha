                    Why Sci-surf
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                            Avoid real IP discovery
                        </p>
                        <p class="pr">
                            When users use crawler software to crawl data or conduct market research, they often perform
                            multiple
                            operations on the target site, and this is likely to trigger countermeasures by the website
                            server,
                            resulting in the IP being blocked. Using an IP proxy can avoid this situation. Through the
                            proxy IP,
                            our
                            real IP address can be hidden, and the security measures of the website can be bypassed in
                            an
                            anonymous
                            form, so as to complete the user's operation.

                            Break through network restrictions
                        </p>
                        <p class="pr">
                            There are many websites that restrict access to users, identify users by reading IP
                            addresses, and
                            use
                            IP proxies to break through these restrictions.

                            Improve running speed

                        </p>
                        <p class="pr">
                            The proxy server has a buffer, which can save the information sent back by the external
                            site. If a
                            user
                            accesses the same information, it can directly obtain the content stored in the buffer,
                            thereby
                            improving the access speed.

                </ul>
                <p class="pr">And that's why we need sci-surf.</p>
                <p class="pr">
                    But most people use the sci-surf to break through the network blockade and freely roam the Internet
                    world. Therefore, we prefer to call it "over the wall".

                    There are numerous ways to sci-surf.

                    There are some awesome projects I would like to introduce. Or maybe it's just my sci-surf journey. I
                    just wanted to document it. This road may not be the fastest, but it can be used as a reference.
                </p>
                <p class="pr">
                    I remember when I first visited github's trending, the "freefq/free" project was at the forefront of
                    daily trends. I learned a lot there and it helped me with sci-surf. Of course, this is also the
                    first project I starred.
                </p>
                <p class="pr">
                    Since then, I have gradually started to understand and learn to use proxy software.
